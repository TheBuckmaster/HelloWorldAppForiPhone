HelloWorldAppForiPhone
======================

This is a tutorial-app-turned-assignment for a class in iPhone development. A user has the option to enter their name in a text field. When they close the pop-up keyboard or press the return key, they will see the label in the middle of the screen display "Hello " followed by either their name if they input it, or the word "World", followed by an exclamation mark.
